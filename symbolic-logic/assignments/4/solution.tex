\section*{Solution to Problem 2}

Let the domain = the set of people. Symbolize the following sentences, using P = is a philosopher, W = is wise, Txy = x teaches y, Lxy = x learns from y, s = Socrates, p = Plato. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Everyone learns from someone \\
        $\forall x \exists y Lxy$
    \item Someone learns from everyone \\
        $\exists x \forall y Lxy$
    \item Someone learns from everyone who learns from them \\
        $\exists x \forall y (Lyx \rightarrow Lxy)$
    \item Someone learns from no-one \\
        $\exists x \forall y \neg Lxy$
    \item Everyone has someone they learn from who also learns from them \\
        $\forall x \exists y (Lxy \land Lyx) $
    \item Some wise people arenâ€™t philosophers, but all philosophers are wise \\
        $(\forall x Px \rightarrow Wx) \land (\exists y Wx \land \lnot Px)$
    \item Anyone who was taught by Socrates was wise  
    \item If everyone is a philosopher, then Socrates is a philosopher 
    \item If anyone is a philosopher, then Socrates is a philosopher 
    \item Anyone who is taught by Socrates learns from Socrates 
    \item Whoever learns from Plato, learns from Socrates 
    \item If no-one is wise, then no-one is a philosopher 
    \item If everyone is taught by a philosopher, then everyone will be wise
\end{itemize}
