\section*{Solution to Problem 7}

Prove rule-soundness of the tree rules for the conditional and the negated conditional.

Rule Soundness: if the premise/input is true in some case/valuation C, then all the lines in at least one of its conclusions/outputs is true in case C too.

\begin{theorem}[Conditional Rule Soundness]
    If $A \rightarrow B$ is true in some case/valuation C, then all the lines in one the tree rule's outputs must be true
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The conditional tree rule is as follows: $A \rightarrow B$ creates a single line with two branches $\neg A$ and $B$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume $A \rightarrow B$ is true in some case/valuation C.
        \item $A \rightarrow B$ has the same truth table as $\neg A \lor B$.
        \item In C, either $A$ is false or $B$ is true.
        \item The $A$ branch is true in C when the value of $A$ is true in C.
        \item The $\neg B$ branch is true in C when the value of $B$ is false in C.
        \item That is all the possible cases or C. So if C is true, then one of the branches are true. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Negated Conditional Rule Soundness]
    If $\neg (A \rightarrow B)$ is true in some case/valuation C, then all the lines in one the tree rule's outputs must be true
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The conditional tree rule is as follows: $A \rightarrow B$ creates two lines $A$ and $\neg B$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assume $\neg(A \rightarrow B)$ is true in some case/valuation C.
        \item $\neg (A \rightarrow B)$ has the same truth table as $A \land \neg B$.
        \item In C, $A$ is true or $B$ is false.
        \item Both new lines ($A$ and $\neg B$) of the tree are true in C.
        \item The negated conditional rule is sound.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\section*{Solution to Problem 8}
 Prove the rule-completeness of the tree rules for the biconditional and the negated biconditional.  
 
Rule Completeness:  If all the lines in one of its conclusions/outputs  is true in some case/valuation C, the premise/input is true in C also.


\begin{theorem}[Biconditional Rule Completeness]
    If all the lines one of the biconditionals outputs is true in some case C, then $A \leftrightarrow B$ is true in C also.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} The binconditional rule completeness
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The biconditional tree rule has two branches with two lines. The first branch has $A$ and $B$ and the second branch has $\neg A$ and $\neg B$. 
        \item Restating the goal, we are showing that if either ($A$ and $B$) or ($\neg A$ and $\neg B$) are true in some case C, then $A \leftrightarrow B$ is true in C also.
        \item Assume either ($A$ and $B$) or ($\neg A$ and $\neg B$) are true in some case C.
        \item The truth table of C only has true outputs when $A$ and $B$ are true or $A$ and $B$ are false. By the truth table of the conditional and truth table of the and. 
        \item The truth table of C is equivalent to the truth table of $A \leftrightarrow B$.
        \item No matter the value of C, C is always true in $A \leftrightarrow B$.
        \item Therefore, the biconditional rule is complete.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Negated Biconditional Rule Completeness]
    If $\neg (A \leftrightarrow B)$ is true in some case/valuation C, then $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow A$ are true in C also.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} The negated binconditional rule completeness
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The negated biconditional tree rule has two branches with two lines. The first branch has $\neg A$ and $B$ and the second branch has $A$ and $\neg B$. 
        \item Restating the goal, we are showing that if either ($\neg A$ and $B$) or ($A$ and $\neg B$) are true in some case C, then $\neg (A \leftrightarrow B)$ is true in C also.
        \item Assume either ($\neg A$ and $B$) or ($A$ and $\neg B$) are true in some case C.
        \item The truth table of C only has true outputs when $A$ is false and $B$ is true or when $A$ is true and $B$ is false. By the truth table of the conditional and truth table of the and. 
        \item The truth table of C is equivalent to the truth table of $\neg (A \leftrightarrow B)$.
        \item No matter the value of C, C is always true in $\neg (A \leftrightarrow B)$.
        \item Therefore, the biconditional rule is complete.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\section*{Solution to Problem 9}

Consider the follow, alternative tree rule for conditionals (X), $p \rightarrow q$ where there are two branches. The first one is $p$ and the second one is $q$


\subsection*{X is not rule sound}
Consider the case where $p$ is false and $q$ is false. The value of the conditional in this case is true. However, the rule outputs two branches that are both false for this case. Thus the rule is not sound. 


\subsection*{X is not rule complete}
Consider the case where the $p$ branch is true and the $q$ branch is not true. One of the branches is true, so the rule input should be true. This corresponds to the case where $p$ is true and $q$ is false. But, the value of the conditional in this case is false. Thus the rule is not complete.


\subsection*{X makes the tree test not sound}

I'll show a tree test for the argument $A \rightarrow B, \neg A, \therefore \neg B$ that is not sound. This argument is invalid, but the tree closes

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{9c}


\subsection*{X makes the tree test not complete}

I'll show a tree test where the argument is valid, but the tree doesn't close. The argument is $A \rightarrow B, A, \therefore B$.
