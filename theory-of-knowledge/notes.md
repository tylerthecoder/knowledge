# Theory of knowledge

## Key Takeaways

There are things that are true, but not known. If something is known, then it is not true. 

Knowledge is a justified true belief. 

Justification is a _good_ connection between why you believe something. 

### View of truth

Anti-realism: There is objective truth
    - Subjectivism: Truth is relative to individuals
    - Cultural relativism: Truth is relative to cultures
    - Determined by conviction 

Realism: This is objective truth

### Types of truth

Physical world propositions
- Iron is heavier than water
- Arkansas is a state in the US
- Anti-realism is hard to justify for these. 

Metaphysical propositions
- God exists

Value propositions
- Killing is wrong


The Knowledge Assumption: If S knows that P, then S has no reason to doubt P. 


Reasons for doubt:
P1. The sense sometimes deceive
P2. I can't tell if the senses are being deceptive
C1. So every sensory experience I have is possibly deceptive
P3. I have a reason to doubt empirical beliefs
C2. None of my beliefs count as knowledge. 

The second argument: the dream argument
Sometimes I see thing in my dream and think they are real.
