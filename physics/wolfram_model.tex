Rules:

Simple: $\{\{x,y\}\} \rightarrow \{\{x,y\}, \{y,z\}\} $

Multi: $\{\{x,y,z\}, \{x,y,w\}\} \rightarrow \{\{x,y,z,w\}\}$ 

Canonical form:
$$\{\{1, 1\}, \{2, 4, 5\}, \{7, 5\}\} -> \{\{3, 8\}, \{2, 7\}, \{5, 4, 1\}, \{4, 6\}, \{5,1, 7\}\}$$
Becomes:
$$\{\{1,2,3\},\{4,4\},\{5,3\}\} -> \{\{3,2,4\}, \{3,4,5\},\{1,5\},\{2,6\}, \{7,8\}\}$$

Can get a single integer for canonical form Flatten and look up in tuple index (Don’t know how this works too well)

Signature:
$$ \{\{x,y\}\} -> \{\{x,y\}, \{y,z\}\} $$ is $1_2 -> 2_2$


You can limit the set of possible rules by saying rules need to be “Left Connected”
This takes the possible number of distinct elements for $2_2 -> 2_2$ rules from 8 to 6. 

$2_2 -> 2_2$ has 562 possible canonical, left connected rules

There is no easy way to compute the number of possible rules for a certain signature


Initial Conditions
The only possible init conditions for 12 {{1,1}} ( A loop ) {{1,2}} (An edge)
To count the number of init conditions you can eliminate equivalent connections


73 inequivalent left-connect 12 -> 22 rules, but none lead to structors more complex than trees (Starting from a single self loop)


This rule produces a basic grid
$$\{\{x, y, y\}, \{z, x, u\}\} -> \{\{y, v, y\}, \{y, z, v\}, \{u, v, v\}\}$$

This rule produces a cone
$$\{\{x, x, y\}, \{x, z, u\}\} -> \{\{u, u, z\}, \{y, v, z\}, \{y, v, z\}\}$$
