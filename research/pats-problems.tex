\begin{definition}[RTAS].\\
    A rectangular TAS (RTAS) is a TAS $\mathcal{T} = (T, \sigma, g, 2)$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item T and $g$ are the same as a TAS
        \item $\sigma$ is a 2-stable seed of L-shape, whose domain is $\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le w \} \bigcup \{ (0, y) \mid 0 \le y \le h    \}$
        \item $\forall t \in T, d \in \{N,E,S,W\}, g(t(d)) = 1$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[PATS]. \\
    GIVEN a pattern $P$ \\
    FIND a smallest directed RTAS that uniquely self-assembles $P$
\end{definition}

If there is only a single black tile in the RTAS. You need more than $O(2n)$ tile types to create a pattern. 

I think you can make a pattern that needs more than 2n tile types if each row / col has to count a different prime number and every time there is an intersection, the color flips


Number of possible RTAS given the pattern is $nxn$. $(2n) * 2^{f(n)} * 4 * f(n) * 2^{f(n)}$

There are $\choose{4(2n+1)}{4(n-1)}$ ways to assign glues to n tiles

The bell numbers describe the number of ways to partition a set. This can be used to think about the number of ways to assign glues to a set of tiles. So this is an upper bound on the number of assemblies producible by a TAS. Bell numbers grow factorially, so there are more ways to make TAS then possible patterns P to make.

This does not take into account that some TASs will produce the same assembly. But all TASs will produce at most 1 assembly since they are directed. 




\begin{definition}[SS-RTAS].\\
    A single seeded rectangular TAS (RTAS) is a TAS $\mathcal{T} = (T, \sigma, g, 2)$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item T and $g$ are the same as a TAS
        \item $\sigma$ is a 2-stable seed of L-shape, whose domain is $\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le w \} \bigcup \{ (0, y) \mid 0 \le y \le h    \}$
        \item $\forall t \in T, d \in \{N,E,S,W\}, g(t(d)) = 1$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[SS PATS]. \\
    GIVEN a pattern $P$ \\
    FIND a smallest directed Single-Seeded TAS that uniquely self-assembles $P$
\end{definition}


Problem 3: 

The RTAS has to assemble the Pattern somewhere in the grid

\begin{definition}[PATSX]. \\
    GIVEN a pattern $P$ \\
    FIND a smallest directed TAS that uniquely self-assembles $P$ in a designated area
\end{definition}

Problem 4: 

Does having a 3rd dimension help? 

\begin{definition}[PATSX]. \\
    GIVEN a pattern $P$ \\
    FIND a smallest directed TAS that uniquely self-assembles $P$ in a designated area
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[PATS3]. \\
    GIVEN a pattern $P$ \\
    FIND a smallest directed 3D RTAS that uniquely self-assembles $P$ at the top of the assembly.
\end{definition}
